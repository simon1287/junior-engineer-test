### Getting Started

Fork this repo by hitting the fork button in the top right corner of the repositorys main page. Then clone the forked 
version of the repo. After cloning the forked repo, checkout a branch and call it something sensible like your-name-tech-test.

### Overview
In this repo there are 3 files, the technical test, associate unit tests and some sample data. 
Your task is to implement the functions in the file junior_tech_test.py such that the tests in
junior_tech_test_tests.py pass when reading the file sample_data.csv

You can run the tests locally either through your IDE or via the command line. By running
```python3 -s junior_tech_test_tests.py``` you should get output detailing if the tests are 
successful. For example, if 8/9 tests are passing you should see something like 
```
Ran 9 tests in 0.050s

FAILED (failures=1)
```

## Requirements

Implement each test such that the associated test case passes. Please don't use the pandas library
or similar as most of the functions become trivial when working with dataframes.

The tests should pass for any input, not just the ones provided in the test cases.

Think carefully about the style of your code and how you would write these in a professional environment.

When you are happy with your code, push your work up to your branch.

There is no time limit, but please don't spend too long on this test, this is just to provide us
something to discuss in an interview and shouldn't be a stressful task!
